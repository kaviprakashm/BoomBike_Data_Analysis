## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service and data analysis been conducting using various EDA technics to assess the demand
- This project provide clarity about demand of bikes how it vary based on several variables 
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands
